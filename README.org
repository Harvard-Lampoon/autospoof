#+title: Lampy Autospoof

[[https://wi11dey.github.io/autospoof/nyt/Lampy_Horseback.png]]

Put in a Google Docs folder with pieces written by the Literature Board, and get out a fully formatted 
website based off of an existing media publication you want to spoof. See [[https://github.com/Harvard-Lampoon/autospoof/blob/master/autospoof.ts][ ~autospoof.ts~ ]] for the magic.

Examples:
- https://thecrimsom.com
- https://wi11dey.github.io/autospoof/nyt/

* Setup
#+begin_src shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Harvard-Lampoon/autospoof.git
$ cd autospoof
$ npx yarn install
$ npx yarn build
#+end_src
* Usage
#+begin_src shell
$ node autospoof.js <siteconfig.yaml> <client_secret.json> <docs> <output>
#+end_src
* Limitations
- Will only handle up to 1000 parody articles for Google Docs ratelimiting reasons (as if lit would ever write more than that)
